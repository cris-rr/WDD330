          <p>
            JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it didn’t implement exceptions at all
            until
            ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a user to an error in a program, it just failed silently in the
            background, and this is sometimes still the case. It might seem like a good idea at first, but the error
            might
            give unexpected or incorrect results that nobody spots, or lurk in the background for a long time before
            causing the program to crash spectacularly. Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to
            track down.

            For this reason, a ninja programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so
            any
            errors can be identified and fixed quickly. In production, a ninja programmer should try to make the code
            fail
            gracefully (although not completely silently ― we still need to know there’s an error), so the user
            experience
            is not affected, if possible. This is achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code
            is tested rigorously.

        <li class="category"><span class="subtitle">Exception Handling:</span>
          <p>
            When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in development as it
            allows us to identify and fix errors. In production, however, it will appear as if the program has crashed,
            which does not reflect well on a ninja programmer.
            It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users,
            but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the
            program running.

          <p>
            Jest11 is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It
            makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.

            This is a good review about Jest.

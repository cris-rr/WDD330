      <li>This week we learn about The windows Object and HTML5 APIs,</li>
      <li>We also review the modern front end development workflow.</li>

          <h4>Window Object (The Browser Objet Model)</h4>
          <p>
            The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used
            to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is
            viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather
            dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if youâ€™re into annoying your users.

            the global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a property
            of the window object.

        <li>
          <p><strong>The window.alert()</strong> method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in
            a dialog box.
            The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The <strong>window.confirm()</strong> method will stop the execution of the program and display a
            confirmation dialog that
            shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean
            values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel:</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong>The window.prompt()</strong> method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog
            that shows a
            message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is
            then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned:</p>
